    <h1>Chips Recipe</h1>
    <img src = "./recipes-images/chips.jpg" height="310" width="310">
    <p>Without question, the humble fried potato, the chip, is a gastronomic phenomenon in itself. The ability potatoes have to get mega crispy on the outside and super-fluffy in the middle when cooked is so good.</p>
    <p> Skinny and shoestring fries are delicious, but a proper fat handcut chip is something else. It’s just a shame that they’re not very good for you, but, like a good old cake, life wouldn’t be quite the same without them. At home, we don’t cook chips very often, so when we do have them, we definitely want the real deal.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>800g Mris Piper potatoes</li>
        <li>Sunflower oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>chop 800g of Maris Piper potatoes into finger-sized chips, leaving the skin on.</li>
        <li>Use a large metal sieve to gently lower the chips into the pan for around 8 minutes, or until soft but not coloured, then remove to a tray to cool.</li>
        <li>Turn the heat up under the oil and return one blanched chip to the oil as a guide again.</li>
        <li>Fry the chips until beautifully golden, then remove to a bowl lined with kitchen paper, shake around a bit, season with sea salt and serve right away.</li>
    </ol>
